# computational_materials_science

The project has been set up to explore Materials science data and get an insight into the efficient-querying method. There are plenty of a number of scientific database projects. We have selected four repositories and dealt with API and distinctive database system to establish a pipeline to our endpoint. It encompasses Python, Linux, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB syntax, SSH Connection and Scientific Domain knowledge.
